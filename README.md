## What Gekko is
Gekko is an in-memory trade order matching engine. It supports limit and market orders.

## What Gekko is not
Gekko is not intended to maintain an accounting database, it just matches trade orders associated to accounts, and returns the necessary data for an accounting system to record the trades.
