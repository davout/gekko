## What Gekko is
Gekko is intended to become a high-performance in-memory trade order matching engine.

## What Gekko is not
Gekko is not intended to maintain an accounting database, it just matches trade orders associated to accounts, and returns the necessary data for an accounting system to record the trades (usually against some sort of RDBMS).
